# ZN80

This is my design for [http://zn80.net](http://zn80.net) based on the default theme Casper for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

# What's inside

This basic theme comes with
- header
- blog title
- blog description
- post header
- post meta
- post footer
- every post has a sharing link for Twitter, App.net and Google+ (I don't like facebook)
- index page shows full post content. If you want, you can change this to show excerpt again (see Casper Theme index.hbs)


# Changelog

## v 1.0

This version is the inital version. When Ghost is updated, I will update this theme to reflect the changes in the Ghost core and Ghost themes. I really want to get the Linked-List feature and will include it in the theme when Ghost supports the feature.
